    <h1>Command Line Pokemon Battle Game</h1>
    <p class="info-about-project">
        This is a command line Pokemon battler game created using:
        Object Oriented Programming in ES6 JavaScript, to create trainers and their Pokemon;
        and Inquirer.js to to handle the Command line aspect of the game.

    <p class="info-about-project">
        Each Pokemon and Trainer were created using Classes.
        The Pokemon class creates a Pokemon with properties Name, Hit Points(HP), Attack Damage(AD), Sound, Move, and
        Type when provided the name.
        The Trainer class creates a trainer with properties Name and Pokebelt, and has a method 'catch' which add
        Pokemon to the Pokebelt.
        <br>
        <br>
        There is also a Battle class which creates a battle arena, with two trainers and two Pokemon.
        This has a method 'turn', which allows one of the Pokemon to attack the other.
        The 'turn' method takes into account a Pokemon's strength or weakness against its opponent, multiplying the AD
        by 1.25 or 0.75 respectively.
        <br>
        <br>
        Using inquirer.js, a command line method was implemented in order to establish a flow through which the initial
        stages of the Pokemon game can be followed through.
