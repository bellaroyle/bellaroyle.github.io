    <h1 id="project-info-heading">Mr Men News</h1>
    <p class="info-about-project">
      This is a Full stack reddit-style news website. (Named Mr Men News as all
      the users have mr men icons.)
      <br />
      <br />
      For the backend I created a database using <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>. I
      then used <strong>Knex.js</strong> to interact with it and build an api
      for my database using an <strong>Express</strong> server. I created
      several end points on my api (for details see the backend code below) that
      I went on to use when making the frontend for the application. I used
      <strong>heroku</strong> to host the api and it can be found
      <a href="https://nc-news-api-br.herokuapp.com/api">here</a>
      <br />
      <br />
      I built the frontend using React with the help of Material UI for some pre
      styled components. I used Netlify to host the application, see the live
      demo below.
      <br />
      <br />
      Watch the video below to see some of the functionality available:
    </p>
    <div id="media-container">
      <div class="media-box">
        <video src="../media/Mr-Men-Recording.mov" controls>
          Video some of the features of the site
        </video>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="how-it-works">
      <h2>Some cool features (and some im planning on adding):</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>The website is logged in as a user:</h3>
          This is to allow for features such as adding and deleting your own
          comments. There is more functionality I would like to add tht will use
          this logged in feature such as posting your own article.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Login/logout switch</h3>
          This toggleable switch allows a user to logout which then blocks their
          ability to post or delete their own comments. Currently this is
          hardcoded to the user 'cooljmessy', I am working on an input appearing
          when trying to login so that any user can login.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>User Profile page</h3>
          If you click on a username, it will take you to their profile page
          which includes their avatar and full name. This profile page also
          shows you all the articles by that user.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Sort by and filter</h3>
          The two bars at the top of the list of articles allow the user to
          specify the type of articles they see. The bars also show the user how
          the articles are currently sorted.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="info-about-project">
      There are more features available, checkout the live demo below and have a
      play around on the app.
