    <p class="info-about-project">
      Meme What you say is a real time multiplayer iOS app. The game is inspired
      by the popular games What Do You Meme and Psych!
      <br /><br />
      The backend of the app was made using firebase which provided the Cloud
      Firestore database, and Cloud Storage bucket for photos. The frontend was
      built using React Native and Expo. While Expo allows deployment to both
      android and ios, the app was styled with iOS in mind however deployment to
      android is part of the apps future plans.

      <h2>The Game:</h2>
      <!-- <p class="info-about-project">
        The premise of the game is fairly simple:
      </p> -->

      <ul>
        <li>
          One person hosts a game, generating a unique room code that they can
          share with their friends.
        </li>
        <li>
          The host's friends then join the room and the host can start the game
          when everyone is ready
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the game has begun, you will see a picture, the objective is to
          come up with the funniest caption.
        </li>
        <li>
          After Each round, every player votes for their favourite (excluding
          their own)
        </li>
        <li>
          after a number of rounds (that the host has chosen) the game is over
          and the player with the most votes is declared the winner!
        </li>
      </ul>
